# Blue Badge Project: Completely Booked
## General Info

For the Blue Badge Group API Project, the goal was to build a .NET Framework API Web Application using n-tier architecture. Our group created ‘Completely Booked’ which is a book publishing web application. The basic function of our application is to search a database of books, authors and publishers. Our data tables include Author, Book, Review and Publisher. We also used Trello to collaborate on tickets and LucidChart to collaborate on our ERD.
